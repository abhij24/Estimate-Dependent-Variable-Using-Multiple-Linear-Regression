# Estimate-Dependent-Variable-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
This project tells us about MLR multiple linear regression analysis based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) assumptions that predicts a response variable y based on two continuous predictor variables (x1, x2) and one categorical independent variable (x3). After creating a training and testing set based on 80%-20% separation, the model was created and put to test to ensure realistic understanding of the parameters of this data set. Model diagnostics assessed indicate that the model is compliant with most OLS assumptions with high practicality of prediction success with the testing set, receiving an R^2 Coefficient of Determination of 0.85, meaning linear combination of predictor variables is 85% responsible for any deviation of y from the predicted values. Therefore, a good predictive model to apply in investigations.
